  <span style="font-size:140%">The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four<br>
     colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn<br>
     blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.</span><br><br><br>
  
   <span style="font-size:160%",><strong>Origin:</strong></span>"
   <span style="font-size:140%">The game "Pac man" was created by Namco in Japan, and released in the U.S. by Midway.<br>
    The idea of Pac-Man was taken from both the image of a pizza with a slice removed and from<br>
    rounding out the Japanese symbol Âè£ (kuchi, lit. "mouth"). By 1981, approximately 250 million games<br>
    of Pac-Man were being played in the U.S. each week on 100,000 Pac-Man machines. Since then, <br>
    Pac-Man has been released on nearly every video game platform.</span>
